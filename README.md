Password Strength Checker

The Password Strength Checker is a simple but powerful Java-based project designed to evaluate how strong a user's password is based on multiple security rules. This project helps users to create more secure passwords and also teaches important programming concepts such as string analysis, condition checks, and validation logic.

The main goal of this project is to:
  Analyse a password entered by the user,
  Check whether it meets important security rules,
  Identify which rules are passed and which are missing,
  Display the overall strength level of the password(weak, very weak, moderate, strong, very strong).
